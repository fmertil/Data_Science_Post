The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution. it contains serveral parameters such as cibil score, income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, assets value, and loan status.


Many libraries have been used  such as matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and scikit-learn for data visualization, data preprocessing, and model training.

3. How CIBIL Score
4.
